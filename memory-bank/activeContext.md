# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Rolling back unified onboarding implementation to meet MVP deadline
- Returning to original, simpler onboarding flow
- Maintaining existing authentication and company setup process

## Recent Changes
- Decision made to postpone unified onboarding implementation
- Preserving unified onboarding work for post-MVP implementation
- Focusing on core MVP features and stability

## Next Steps
1. Remove unified onboarding components and routes
2. Ensure original onboarding flow is fully functional
3. Verify all authentication flows work as expected
4. Test company setup process
5. Focus on remaining MVP requirements

## Active Decisions
- Unified onboarding postponed to post-MVP phase
- Maintaining simpler authentication flow for MVP
- Preserving unified onboarding code in memory bank for future implementation

## Current Challenges
- Meeting MVP deadline
- Ensuring smooth transition back to original flow
- Maintaining existing functionality during rollback

## Technical Considerations
- Careful removal of unified onboarding routes
- Verification of existing auth flows
- Ensuring no regression in current functionality
- Maintaining clean codebase for future implementation

## Current Focus
- Form validation and error handling
- User experience improvements
- Loading state management

## Recent Changes
### Authentication
- Set up Supabase Auth integration
- Implemented protected routes
- Added session management
- Created user profile handling

### UI/UX
- Implemented responsive design
- Added loading indicators
- Integrated toast notifications
- Enhanced form feedback

## Next Steps
1. Email Verification
   - Implement email verification flow
   - Add email templates
   - Handle verification status

2. Password Reset
   - Create password reset flow
   - Add security measures
   - Implement email notifications

3. Error Handling
   - Enhance error messages
   - Add retry mechanisms
   - Improve error logging

4. Testing
   - Add unit tests for components
   - Implement integration tests
   - Set up E2E testing

## Active Decisions
1. Form Management
   - Using React Hook Form for form state
   - Zod for schema validation
   - Custom hooks for form logic

2. State Management
   - React Context for global state
   - Local state for form data
   - Supabase for data persistence

3. UI Components
   - ShadcnUI as base components
   - Custom styling with Tailwind
   - Responsive design patterns

## Current Challenges
1. Loading States
   - Implementing consistent loading UX
   - Managing multiple async operations
   - Preventing form submission during loading

2. Error Handling
   - Standardizing error messages
   - Handling network errors
   - Providing user feedback

3. Form Validation
   - Complex validation rules
   - Cross-field validation
   - Async validation handling

## Technical Considerations
1. Performance
   - Code splitting strategy
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Loading time improvements

2. Security
   - Input sanitization
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting implementation

3. Testing
   - Test coverage goals
   - Testing strategy
   - CI/CD integration

## Known Issues
- Need to handle edge cases in form validation
- Need to add loading states
- Need to implement error boundaries
- Need to add comprehensive testing
