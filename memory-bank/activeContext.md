## Directory Structure Status

### Current Structure Assessment
The project currently has a solid foundation with clear separation of concerns, but some areas need optimization:

#### Strengths
- Clear separation of core concerns (components, pages, context, etc.)
- Well-organized infrastructure (migrations, scripts, docs)
- Proper configuration file placement
- Memory bank structure follows best practices

#### Areas for Improvement
1. **Components Directory**
   - Need to reorganize into feature-based structure
   - Move shared components to common directory
   - Separate layout components
   - Current Status: Partially organized, needs restructuring

2. **Pages Directory**
   - Currently flat structure needs feature-based organization
   - Missing proper lazy loading implementation
   - Current Status: Functional but needs reorganization

3. **Utils Directory**
   - Needs better categorization
   - API utilities should be separated
   - Current Status: Basic structure, needs expansion

4. **Types Organization**
   - Could benefit from domain-based organization
   - Some types could be co-located with features
   - Current Status: Basic structure, needs enhancement

### Next Steps
1. Create new directory structure according to systemPatterns.md guidelines
2. Move components to feature-based organization
3. Implement proper lazy loading for pages
4. Reorganize utils and types directories
5. Update import statements systematically
6. Add README files to key directories

### Migration Priority
1. High: Component reorganization
2. Medium: Page structure improvement
3. Medium: Utils categorization
4. Low: Types reorganization

## Immediate Development Structure Guidelines

### Forward-Compatible Development (Pre-Restructure)
To minimize restructuring effort while maintaining development velocity, follow these patterns for new code:

#### New Components
```
src/components/[feature]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/     # New feature-specific components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/          # New feature-specific UI components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/       # New feature-specific utilities
```

#### New Pages
```
src/pages/[feature]/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx    # Main feature page
```

#### New Types
```
src/types/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [feature]/   # Feature-specific types
```

### Current Development Rules
1. **New Features**
   - Create feature-specific directories upfront
   - Keep related code co-located
   - Use index.ts files for exports

2. **Shared Components**
   - If clearly reusable, place in `src/components/common/`
   - Document reuse potential in component comments

3. **Documentation**
   - Add README.md in new feature directories
   - Document component purposes and relationships
   - Mark temporary solutions with TODO comments

4. **Imports**
   - Use relative paths for feature-specific imports
   - Use absolute paths for shared utilities
   - Keep import statements organized and grouped

This approach allows continued development while making future restructuring easier.
