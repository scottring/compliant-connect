# Project Progress

## MVP Development Status

### Completed Features
- Initial UI components setup
- Basic database schema
- Supabase integration
- Local development setup (Docker, Supabase CLI)
- Streamlined MCP configuration (using global settings)
- Basic "Add Supplier" functionality (name only initially, then with contacts)
- Basic "Create Tag" functionality
- Basic "Create Question" functionality
- Section/subsection structure implementation
- RPC implementation for question-tag association
- Enhanced question bank schema
- Improved PIR workflow implementation (basic structure)
- Company context management with default company logic (initial version)
- **React Query Integration (Core):**
    - Setup `QueryClientProvider`.
    - Refactored `use-question-bank`, `use-tags`, `use-company-data` hooks.
    - Refactored `Suppliers`, `AdminSettings`, `RequestSheetModal`, `SupplierProducts` pages/components.
    - Simplified `AuthContext`, created `useCompanyData`.
    - Updated `CompanySelector`, `Navigation`, `ProtectedRoute`, `AuthDebug`.

### In Progress
1.  **Authentication and Company Management**
    *   Company context switching/reliability (Now handled via `useCompanyData` state)
    *   Role-based access implementation (Basic implementation using `useCompanyData` in `Navigation`/`ProtectedRoute`)
    *   Error handling improvements (Partially addressed by React Query error states)
    *   Loading state refinement (Partially addressed by React Query loading states)

2.  **Question Bank and PIR System**
    *   Question bank UI refinement (Ongoing)
    *   PIR workflow implementation (Basic fetching in `SupplierProducts`, creation in `RequestSheetModal` refactored)
    *   Response submission system enhancement (Pending)
    *   Review process setup improvements (Pending)
    *   Validation implementation (Ongoing)
    *   **Server State:** Core data fetching/mutations refactored to use React Query.

### Pending Work
1.  **Core Authentication Flows**
    *   Robust multi-company context switching
    *   Complete role-based access control implementation
    *   Enhanced role-based views

2.  **PIR System Development**
    *   Complete PIR creation interface
    *   Enhance response submission forms
    *   Develop review dashboard
    *   Improve status tracking (Refactor `SupplierProducts` status display)

3.  **Refactoring & Cleanup**
    *   **Complete React Query Rollout:** Apply pattern to remaining components/hooks.
    *   **Update Consumers:** Update components using old patterns.
    *   **Address `AppContext`:** Refactor/remove duplicated server state management.
    *   Refactor `utils.ts` functions using hardcoded URLs/project IDs.
    *   Consolidate Supabase client usage.
    *   Review schema design (contacts, roles).

4.  **Testing and Optimization**
    *   Authentication flow testing
    *   Company relationship validation
    *   Access control verification
    *   PIR system testing
    *   Performance optimization
    *   Basic polish

### Implementation Timeline
*   Continue implementing PIR workflow features
*   Finish role-based access control
*   Complete testing of key features
*   Focus on stability and performance

### Known Issues
1.  **High Priority**
    *   Need to refactor utility functions using hardcoded URLs/project IDs.
    *   Need to confirm correct Supabase client is used *everywhere*.
    *   Company state management may have timing edge cases.

2.  **Medium Priority**
    *   Review schema design (contacts, roles).
    *   Implement remaining PIR workflow features.
    *   Improve error handling in question bank management.

### Next Steps
1.  Complete React Query rollout and associated cleanup/consumer updates.
2.  Continue implementing PIR system features.
3.  Refactor `utils.ts` to remove hardcoded URLs.
4.  Enhance testing coverage for critical features.

### Success Metrics
- [x] Authentication system functional (`AuthContext`)
- [x] Local development environment operational
- [x] Basic Supplier creation working (Refactored w/ React Query)
- [x] Basic Tag creation working (Refactored w/ React Query)
- [x] Question creation (with tags) working reliably (Refactored w/ React Query)
- [x] Section/subsection organization implemented (DB + Refactored w/ React Query)
- [x] Company data fetching/context management (via `useCompanyData`)
- [x] Core Server State Management Refactored (React Query in key areas)
- [ ] Company relationships validated
- [ ] Role-based access working fully
- [ ] PIR creation working (Basic mutation exists, needs UI integration/testing)
- [ ] Response submission functional
- [ ] Critical features tested (especially refactored areas)

### Notes
- Significant progress with question bank implementation using section/subsection organization
- Fixed question-tag association issue using RPC functions
- Added extensive error handling and logging throughout the application
- Improved data model with clearer relationships between sections, subsections, and questions
- Enhanced loading state management across critical components
- Fixed inconsistencies in schema references between code and migrations
