# Project Progress

## MVP Development Status

### Completed Features
- Initial UI components setup
- Basic database schema
- Supabase integration
- Local development setup (Docker, Supabase CLI)
- Streamlined MCP configuration (using global settings)
- Basic "Add Supplier" functionality (name only initially, then with contacts)
- Basic "Create Tag" functionality
- Basic "Create Question" functionality
- Section/subsection structure implementation
- RPC implementation for question-tag association
- Enhanced question bank schema
- Company context management with default company logic (initial version)
- **React Query Integration (Core):**
    - Setup `QueryClientProvider`.
    - Refactored `use-question-bank`, `use-tags`, `use-company-data` hooks.
    - Refactored `Suppliers`, `AdminSettings`, `RequestSheetModal`, `SupplierProducts` pages/components.
    - Simplified `AuthContext`, created `useCompanyData`.
    - Updated `CompanySelector`, `Navigation`, `ProtectedRoute`, `AuthDebug`.
- **PIR Creation & Display (Core Workflow):**
    - Fixed modal rendering crash (`React.Children.only` workaround).
    - Implemented product suggestion workflow (using `suggested_product_name` column) to handle RLS.
    - Fixed RLS policies for `pir_requests` (SELECT) and `pir_tags` (INSERT/SELECT) to support workflow.
    - Fixed data insertion logic (`supplier_company_id` in `useCreatePIRMutation`).
    - Fixed data fetching/display logic on `SupplierDetail` and `SupplierProducts` pages for suggested products.
    - Fixed data display on `SupplierCard` (snake_case vs camelCase).

### In Progress
1.  **Authentication and Company Management**
    *   Company context switching/reliability (Now handled via `useCompanyData` state - needs further testing)
    *   Role-based access implementation (Basic implementation using `useCompanyData`, RLS policies updated for PIRs/Tags - needs full review/completion)
    *   Error handling improvements (Partially addressed by React Query error states)
    *   Loading state refinement (Partially addressed by React Query loading states)

2.  **Question Bank and PIR System**
    *   Question bank UI refinement (Ongoing)
    *   PIR workflow implementation (Core creation/display fixed, response/review pending)
    *   Response submission system enhancement (Pending)
    *   Review process setup improvements (Pending)
    *   Validation implementation (Ongoing)
    *   **Server State:** Core data fetching/mutations refactored to use React Query.

### Pending Work
1.  **Core Authentication Flows**
    *   Robust multi-company context switching testing/refinement
    *   Complete role-based access control implementation & testing
    *   Enhanced role-based views

2.  **PIR System Development**
    *   Enhance response submission forms
    *   Develop review dashboard
    *   Improve status tracking/display (Refactor `SupplierProducts` status display, consider `SupplierDetail` count)

3.  **Refactoring & Cleanup**
    *   **Complete React Query Rollout:** Apply pattern to remaining components/hooks.
    *   **Update Consumers:** Update components using old patterns.
    *   **Address `AppContext`:** Refactor/remove duplicated server state management.
    *   Refactor `utils.ts` functions using hardcoded URLs/project IDs.
    *   Consolidate Supabase client usage.
    *   Review schema design (contacts, roles, `pir_requests.note` column?).
    *   **Remove `<FormControl>` workaround:** Investigate root cause of `React.Children.only` error if possible, or document workaround.
    *   Remove temporary RLS test files (`temp_disable_product_rls.sql`).

4.  **Testing and Optimization**
    *   Authentication flow testing
    *   Company relationship validation
    *   Access control verification (especially updated RLS)
    *   PIR system testing (creation, display, suggestion workflow)
    *   Performance optimization
    *   Basic polish

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
### Implementation Timeline
*   Continue implementing PIR workflow features (Response/Review)
*   Finish role-based access control review/testing
*   Complete testing of key features (PIR creation/display)
*   Focus on stability and performance
=======
### 1. Authentication
- Setting up Supabase Auth
- Debugging "failed to fetch" and related errors during login/signup
- Implementing user sessions
- Role-based access control
- Company relationship management
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

### Known Issues
1.  **High Priority**
    *   Need to refactor utility functions using hardcoded URLs/project IDs.
    *   Need to confirm correct Supabase client is used *everywhere*.
    *   Company state management may have timing edge cases.
    *   Root cause of `React.Children.only` error requiring `<FormControl>` removal workaround is unknown.

2.  **Medium Priority**
    *   Review schema design (contacts, roles, `pir_requests.note` column?).
    *   Implement remaining PIR workflow features (Response/Review).
    *   Improve error handling in question bank management.

### Next Steps
1.  Complete React Query rollout and associated cleanup/consumer updates.
2.  Implement PIR Response/Review features.
3.  Refactor `utils.ts` to remove hardcoded URLs.
4.  Enhance testing coverage for critical features (PIR workflow, RLS).
5.  Investigate/document the `<FormControl>` workaround.
