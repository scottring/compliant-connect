# Project History

## Project Genesis (March 2024)
- Initial project setup with Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, and Supabase
- Established core project structure and development patterns
- Created initial memory bank documentation system

## Authentication System Evolution
### Initial Implementation
- Basic Supabase Auth integration
- Simple user profile management
- Single-role company associations

### Refinement Phase
- Enhanced multi-tenant model supporting supplier/customer/both roles
- Improved company relationship management
- Added invitation-based registration flow
- Identified and addressed issues with:
  - Company state management
  - User-company relationships
  - Registration and login flows

## Core Workflows Development
### Question Bank System
- Implemented central repository for compliance questions
- Added support for multiple question types
- Developed tagging system for categorization
- Created section/subsection organization

### Product Information Request (PIR)
- Built PIR creation and management interface
- Implemented tag-based question filtering
- Added email notification system
- Developed status tracking

### Response Management
- Created interactive supplier response forms
- Implemented question-specific communication threads
- Added smart answer reuse functionality
- Developed progress tracking

## Technical Infrastructure
### Development Environment
- Set up development, staging, and production environments
- Configured Supabase instances for each environment
- Implemented MCP capabilities for database analysis
- Added advanced MCP server with write capabilities

### Directory Structure
- Initial project structure setup
- Planned reorganization for feature-based architecture
- Documentation of forward-compatible patterns

## Lessons Learned
### Authentication & Company Management
- Importance of clear company role definitions
- Need for robust invitation system
- Critical nature of proper state management
- Value of comprehensive error handling

### Development Process
- Benefits of structured memory bank documentation
- Importance of clear technical patterns
- Need for systematic approach to feature development
- Value of proper type definitions and data modeling

## Timeline of Key Decisions
### March 2024
1. Adoption of Next.js 14 and Supabase stack
2. Implementation of memory bank documentation system
3. Development of multi-tenant authentication system
4. Enhancement of company relationship management
5. Refinement of registration and login flows

## Architectural Evolution
### Initial Architecture
- Basic Next.js setup
- Simple Supabase integration
- Minimal state management

### Current Architecture
